    "text": "Title: Moneyball: Visualizations of Baseball Salaries.\nGroup members: Huthaifa Mohammad, Sidney Langford, Suweda Said, Basir Talayee, Harlan Grady\nDescription: We aim to look at the relationship between player salary and game stats. Some of these stats include: batting average, pitching stats, and fielding stats. If we have more time, we can also look at how team wins/losses affect player salary.\nInspirations: Since we are a group interested in sports, we decided to choose a baseball dataset since baseball is one of the most stats-heavy professional sports. With a plethora of data to work with, we plan on exploring our many interests while still creating a cohesive project.\nPlan: Wednesday 11/13: Complete sketch Friday 11/15: Create basic visualizations/better understand the data Monday 11/18: Finalize research question + finish wrangling the data Friday 11/22: Finalize Visualizations Monday 11/25: Finalize Presentation/Report Wednesday-Friday 11/27-11/29: Thanksgiving break Monday 12/2: Last edits on presentation 12/9-12/13: Revise/film final presentation",
