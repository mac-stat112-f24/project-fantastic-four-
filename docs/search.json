    "text": "What question are you trying to answer?\n\nWhat baseball teams have won the most over time\n\nWhat are the trends between winners? (Traits, game stats)\n\nHow do player’s stats affect their salaries?\n\nAre there any factors affecting their salaries like location and popularity?\n\nInsights in the history of baseball? What factors are associated with success historically? What is the average age of players and how has that changed historically? Which places/locations most of the stars do come from historically?\n\n\nWhy is it important or interesting?\n\nBaseball is one of the most popular sports in the US with millions of viewers each year. There are many factors that contribute to team wins and we would like to explore potential factors contributing to these wins.\n\nBaseball is the most analytical sport in the world, and has a long history of accurately recorded data both simple and complex.\n\n\nIf needed, What background information is necessary here?\n\nA comprehension of how the game of baseball has evolved over a 144 year period. Here is a brief summary of the basic changes since MLB’s inception. https://blastmotion.com/blog/evolution-of-sport-baseball/?srsltid=AfmBOooVC-YIx4L9Jc6uylHY6jQFwAok4YbATH4AUn0Qp9lL8C6-U1ji#gref\nKnowledge of the rules of baseball are necessary to understand this data.

Some of these stats include: batting average, pitching stats, and fielding stats. If we have more time, we can also look at how team wins/losses affect player salary.\nInspirations: Since we are a group interested in sports, we decided to choose a baseball dataset since baseball is one of the most stats-heavy professional sports. With a plethora of data to work with, we plan on exploring our many interests while still creating a cohesive project.\nPlan: Wednesday 11/13: Complete sketch Friday 11/15: Create basic visualizations/better understand the data Monday 11/18: Finalize research question + finish wrangling the data Friday 11/22: Finalize Visualizations Monday 11/25: Finalize Presentation/Report Wednesday-Friday 11/27-11/29: Thanksgiving break Monday 12/2: Last edits on presentation 12/9-12/13: Revise/film final presentation",
